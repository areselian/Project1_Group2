San francisco Listing data analysis

Using the Inside Airbnb listings data for San Francisco

Python Packages used in the project:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
This project is meant to give deeper understanding of the airbnb listing data.

##Final Findings Summarized:
Most of the listings are clustered near the bart stations and center of the city
Mission (141), Western Addition (105) and Upper Market (78) at the top 3 neighborhoods with most listings
Prices very wildly based on property and room types.The most frequently listered/rentered apartment types are the following top 3:

- Apartment
- House
- Condominium

Also, seems that people list their entire residency more than half the times, followed by private room. And not surprisingly, Apartment and houses take up an overwhelming majority of all listings, although we do see few instances unfamiliar residencies here and there. This tells us that we should keep our eye on the property and room types when predicting the prices of listings.

Listings with prices around $180 - 300 get the most reviews, meaning that they are booked most often.

Cancellation policies are fairly spread out, but it doesnâ€™t make a big difference for most people.

I have also analysed what words come up the most when people describe their homes

From this, we can tell that unique words like "private", "home", "access", "bedroom", "room",  are very commonly used words when hosts are describing their homes.

This makes sense because people typically use Airbnb because they simply need a place to sleep. Primarily purpose of airbnb isn't to provide luxuary hotel suites, but convenient place to stay that are private. Hosts naturally understand such purpose and create their summaries based on location and distance rather than the housing itself.
